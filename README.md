Exercise 1) Python file highestProduct.py, calculates the biggest product with 3 integers in a list. If the input list is small then there is no reason not just use sort, but if the list given to the function is a large list with many integers, then it would be better to implement the select algorithm to select out the three biggest integers, then find their product. 

Exercise 2) API showing various stations with information about how many available bikes and how many spots are left to leave your bike

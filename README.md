# bicycleLocation: Application with bicycle station locations from API
Exercise 1) Python file highestProduct.py, calculates the biggest product with 3 integers in a list. If the input list is small then there is no reason not to just use sort, but if the list given to the function is a large list with many integers, then it would be better to implement the select algorithm to select out the three biggest integers, then find their product. This is because select has a better runtime

Exercise 2) API showing various stations with information about how many available bikes and how many spots are left to leave your bike, red markers indicate that there are currently no available bikes on these locations, it will therefore not be marked green when clicked on. Green marker indicates that you have clicked on it, information about the station will be displayed underneath the map. The dropdown can also be used to search for stations and will update when you click on the map aswell.
